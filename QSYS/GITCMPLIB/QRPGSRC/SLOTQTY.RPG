     F*      - $PTFR3 was being subtracted from the allocated qty. It
     F*        already is subtracted from the stock qty.

     C*  Calculate physical quantity in slot.
     C*
     C*  Note: The quantities that are used to calculate the physical
     C*        slot quantity are part of processes which should be
     C*        completed soon. We can not wait until the processes
     C*        are closed to say the stock is or isn't there.
     C*
     C*        For example: A replenishment request can not be refused
     C*        because the picks that depleted the slot have not been
     C*        closed yet. Timing is everything.
